# Upgrades
- X-belt tensioner: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683070
  * Having a tight x-belt made all the difference in the world. I actually had to manually tighten it before I could even print this tensioner. Before tightening it down, I couldn't create good circles and it prevented me from making a lot of other upgrades.
- Y-belt tensioner: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1959208
- Front frame brace: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1857991
- T-corner brace: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1672959
- Centered fan duct: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1620630
- Wingnut knobs: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2000216
  * they really are pretty useful
- Bed spring washers: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1895223
  * seemed like a waste of time, I'm not sure if they actually make anything better, but they do keep the springs straight
- Extruder button: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1935151
- Universal spool holder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:767317
- Top mounted spool holder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2162266
  * a little wobbly, I've read that top mounted spools create instability on the frame so we'll see how it goes. It saves desk space though, so I'm keeping it for now.
  * it actually moves laterally quite a bit, I tried to make a brace for it but I don't think it's going to help

# Planned upgrades
- Offset Y Belt Holder - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3085862
- Wall mounted spool holder - creating myself
- fiber reinforced belts - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071K8HYB4
- auto bed leveler - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073XC5T7B
  * using https://3dprint.wiki/reprap/anet/a8/improvement/autobedleveling#sensor_support for reference
  * will require sensor support for extruder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1911146
  * also requires a wiring connector which I don't have: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28QHF7
  * and need to rethink the cooling duct because most won't fit anymore due to the sensor support.

# Installed hardware
- Solid Polymer bearing replacement: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPRCMJS
- MOSFET: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HEQVQAK
- Raspberry Pi 3B+: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BDR5PDW
  * installed octopi on it: https://octoprint.org/download/
  
# Software
- Modeling: https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview
  * free for hobbyists, tons of youtube videos and tutorials online 
- Slicing: https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software
- Marlin: http://marlinfw.org/
  * using the a8 example configuration with auto bed leveling set with the PROBE_MANUALLY flag

# Unused upgrades
- Filament guide: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764285
  * I printed it draft, and it was very scratchy sounding while filament was going through so I took it off. I also didn't like how filament could get stuck in the gap for loading filament into the loop.
