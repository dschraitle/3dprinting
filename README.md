  * they really are pretty useful
- Bed spring washers: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1895223

- Universal spool holder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:767317
- Top mounted spool holder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2162266
  * a little wobbly, I've read that top mounted spools create instability on the frame so we'll see how it goes. It saves desk space though, so I'm keeping it for now.
