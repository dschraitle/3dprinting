# This file contains common pin mappings for Anet A8 printer from 2016
# and 2017. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for
# the AVR atmega1284p.

# Note that the "make flash" command does not work with Anet boards -

# Bed probing hardware
######################################################################

# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.
[probe]
pin: ^!PC4
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
x_offset: 65
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -36
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
#z_offset: 2
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 1
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# Bed leveling support
######################################################################

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#
#  Visual Examples:
#   rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
#               x---x---x (max_point)
#               |
#               x---x---x
#                       |
#   (min_point) x---x---x
#
#   round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
#                  x (0,r) end
#                /
#              x---x---x
#                        \
#   (-r,0) x---x---x---x---x (r,0)
#            \
#              x---x---x
#                    /
#                  x  (0,-r) start
#
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds.  Note that the
#   radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the mesh_origin option.
#   This parameter must be provided for round beds and omitted for rectangular
#   beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center x,y coordinate of the mesh for round beds.  This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location.  It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius.  Default is 0,0.  This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
mesh_min: 35,10
#   Defines the minimum x,y coodinate of the mesh for rectangular beds.  This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This will be the first
#   point probed, nearest to the origin. This parameter must be provided for
#   rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 210, 174
#   Defines the maximum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular beds.
#   Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will be the
#   furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter must be
#   provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.



# Safe Z homing. One may use this mechanism to home the Z axis at a
# specific XY coordinate. This is useful if the toolhead, for example
# has to move to the center of the bed before Z can be homed.
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 45,136
#   A X,Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
